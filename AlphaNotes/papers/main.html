<p><strong>Why I Plan to Pursue Graduate Studies in Financial
Engineering</strong></p>
<p>My interest in financial engineering crystallized during a
Computational Finance course in my sophomore year, when the curriculum
shifted from John C. Hull’s intuition-driven exposition to Steven
Shreve’s <em>Stochastic Calculus for Finance</em>. Working through Itô’s
Lemma revealed how assumptions about volatility translate directly into
hedging errors and pricing accuracy. For the first time, I saw markets
as mathematically structured systems where rigor is indispensable
because real capital is at stake.</p>
<p>That realization exposed gaps in my preparation. During my internship
at Trade Vectors, I processed equity data and backtested trading
signals, but many strategies deteriorated out-of-sample or proved highly
sensitive to parameter choices. While I could implement models, I lacked
the theoretical depth to diagnose why they failed. To address this, I
completed QuantNet’s C++ Programming for Financial Engineering course
with Distinction, where building pricing engines and numerical routines
from first principles emphasized computational efficiency and numerical
stability.</p>
<p>My most significant academic growth emerged through research on
recession forecasting under Dr. Manoj Kumar Yadav. While analyzing U.S.
Treasury yield spreads, I identified systematic gaps in bond maturities
during recessionary periods that conventional imputation methods treated
as random noise, distorting cross-tenor correlations. By reformulating
the problem using Wasserstein Gradient Flows, I preserved distributional
geometry more effectively, leading to materially different economic
insights. This experience taught me that progress in quantitative
research comes not from optimization tricks but from choosing
mathematics that respects the nature of the data.</p>
<p>These experiences have clarified my goal of pursuing quantitative
research at the intersection of stochastic modeling and risk analysis.
Graduate studies in financial engineering represent the essential next
step to deepen my theoretical foundations while maintaining the
connection to practical implementation that has defined my
development.</p>
<p><strong>What Motivates Me to Apply to the Baruch MFE
Program</strong></p>
<p>Baruch MFE’s blend of practical focus and academic rigor makes it
ideal for my development. Three aspects particularly motivate my
application.</p>
<p>First, the curriculum directly addresses challenges I have
encountered. The core sequence in stochastic calculus, numerical
methods, and computational finance provides the mathematical foundations
I need to move beyond empirical pattern recognition toward principled
model development. Courses like <em>Risk Management</em> and
<em>Algorithmic Trading Strategies</em> connect to my industry
experience at Trade Vectors and QuantEdge, where I learned that
successful quantitative trading requires understanding execution
frictions, transaction costs, and changing market regimes.</p>
<p>Second, Baruch’s faculty work on problems aligned with my research
interests. Professor Dan Stefanica’s expertise in numerical methods for
derivative pricing addresses computational challenges I encountered when
building pricing engines. His focus on Monte Carlo simulation directly
relates to the balance between accuracy and efficiency that defines
production quantitative systems. Professor Peter Carr’s research on
volatility modeling and exotic options connects to my work with
stochastic differential equations, where I have seen how the same
mathematical frameworks govern both image despeckling and financial
derivatives.</p>
<p>Third, Baruch’s location in New York City and strong industry
connections provide unparalleled access to the quantitative finance
ecosystem. The practicum requirement ensures exposure to real problems
from leading firms, offering the practical validation essential for
developing research that creates measurable impact.</p>
<p>The combination of rigorous coursework, faculty expertise, industry
integration, and the collaborative culture among students creates an
environment where mathematical precision and market reality continually
inform one another. This balance is what I have sought throughout my
undergraduate years, and Baruch MFE represents the natural continuation
of that journey.</p>
<p><strong>My Career Goals Upon Graduation</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to work as a quantitative researcher at a leading
proprietary trading firm, developing systematic strategies that identify
market inefficiencies through rigorous statistical methods and machine
learning. I am drawn to proprietary trading because ideas are evaluated
through real performance rather than theoretical appeal.</p>
<p>In my first two years after graduation, I plan to build
production-quality strategies that account for transaction costs,
execution frictions, capacity constraints, and changing market regimes.
My experience has shown me that models often fail not because the
mathematics is incorrect, but because practical constraints are
misunderstood or ignored. I am particularly interested in combining
machine learning with traditional quantitative methods in ways that
remain interpretable and robust across different market conditions. The
technical depth from Baruch MFE will prepare me to work on problems
requiring mastery of stochastic modeling, numerical optimization, and
market microstructure simultaneously.</p>
<p>By years three to five, I aim to take on greater responsibility in
strategy development and contribute to the intellectual culture of my
team. I hope to mentor junior researchers, helping them navigate the
transition from academic training to production systems just as senior
colleagues will guide me early in my career. I also intend to maintain
connections with the academic community through Baruch’s alumni network
and ongoing research collaborations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am driven by the belief that financial markets, though
seemingly chaotic, possess underlying structure that can be understood
and modeled using the right mathematical frameworks. I aim to build a
career at this intersection of theory and practice, applying
mathematical rigor alongside practical insight to improve market
efficiency and understanding. The Baruch MFE program offers the
technical depth, industry exposure, and collaborative environment
necessary to pursue this vision with clarity and purpose.</p>
